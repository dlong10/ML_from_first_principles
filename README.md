#**Machine Learning from First Principles**

##
My notes on key Machine Learning concepts - trying to understand and derive algorithms from scratch.

Inspired by Richard Feynman, Naval Ravikant who both highlighted the importance of understanding concepts at a deep level. 

Concept taken directly from Egor Howell.

Code extracted directly from Machine Learning Specialisation (Andrew Ng, Coursera) - an excellent course.
